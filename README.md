# BepinexSteamInstaller

A small util to aid in installation of BepInEx into the correct directory of a steam game.
It downloads BepInEx from Github and unzips it to a folder inside the game directory. 
Two symbolic links are created to make current or fututre steam workshop mods work out of the box.

On a standard windows steam installation nothing more than the name of the game is needed.

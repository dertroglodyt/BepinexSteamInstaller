# BepinexSteamInstaller

A small util to aid in installation of BepInEx into the correct directory of a steam game.
It downloads BepInEx from Github and unzips it to a folder inside the game directory. 
Two symbolic links are created to make current or fututre steam workshop mods work out of the box.

For the two symbolic links to be created the tool has to be run with admin rights. Everything else works with only user rights.

On a standard windows steam installation nothing more than the name of the game is needed.
